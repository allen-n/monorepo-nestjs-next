# NestJS Next.js tRPC Monorepo

This is a monorepo that uses NestJS for the server and Next.js for the client. It uses tRPC for the API. Working through the [tomray tutorial](https://www.tomray.dev/nestjs-nextjs-trpc).

## To Dos

- [ ] Implement tRPC (or decide that I don't want to use it)
- [ ] review my auth stack and see if I want to use it or switch to something like lucia
- [ ] put it out into the world and get feedback!
